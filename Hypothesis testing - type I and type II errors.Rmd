### Assignment:

#### Set your type I error risk tolerance (alpha) to 0.05.

#### Identify the distribution of a sample mean from standard normal with sample size of 30.

#### Use qnorm() to identify the cutoff for testing

#### * Ho: $\mu \ge 0$
#### * Ha: $\mu < 0$

#### Use R to randomly generate 1,000 standard normal samples.  Each sample is size 30.

#### What fraction of samples give a sample average greater than the cutoff?

#### Plot a histogram of your sample averages.

 

```{r}

alpha = 0.05
n <- 30
mu <- 0
sigma <- 1/sqrt(n)

qnorm(p = 0.05, mean = 0, sd = sigma)

M <- matrix(data = rnorm(n = 1000*n), nrow = 1000, ncol = n)

head(M)

M_Means <- rowMeans(M)

sum(M_Means < qnorm(p=0.05, mean=0, sd=sigma))

hist(M_Means)

```

## About %5 of the samples give a sample average greater than the cutoff
