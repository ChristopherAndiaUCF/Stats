### Assignment:
#### Find some data online that includes money, prices, expenses, etc.
#### Plot the histogram of your data.
#### Use your data to estimate the parameters of a log-normal distribution.
#### Plot the estimated density of your log-normal distribution.
#### How does your data compare to your density?


```{r}
housing.df <- read.csv("Groveland.csv", header = TRUE)
library(readr)

Price <- parse_number(housing.df$Current.Price)


hist(Price, main = "Selling Price of Homes ")

dlnorm_x <- dlnorm(
  x = Price,
  meanlog = 0,
  sdlog = 1,
  log = FALSE
)
plot(
  x = Price,
  y = dlnorm_x,
  main = "Density of standard log-normal",
  type = "l"
)

```

### The data compares well to the density plot. Data is skewed to the left.
