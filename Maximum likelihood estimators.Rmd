### Assignment:

#### 3  3  3  3  4  5  5  9 11 12

#### Assume that this data is independent, identically distributed from a exponential distribution. Use the maximum likelihood to estimate the parameter..


```{r}
v_exp <- c(3,3,3,3,4,5,5,9,11,12)
x_bar <- mean(
  v_exp
)
n <- length(
  v_exp
)
lambda <- seq(
  from = 1,
  to = 10,
  length = 1000
)
L <- lambda^(n*x_bar)*exp(-n*lambda)
lambda[which.max(L)]

```
