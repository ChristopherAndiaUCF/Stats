### Assignment:

### Generate at least 100 binomial random variables with n = 30, p = 1/2.

### Convert the counts to proportions.

### Plot the histogram of your proportions.

### Run the shapiro.test() on your proportions.

### How does your data compare to a normal random variable?


```{r}

x <- rbinom(
  n=100,
  size = 30,
  prob=1/2)/30

hist(x,
     main = "Histogram of Proportions of Binomial Random Variables")

shapiro.test(x)


```

#### Random binomial variables are a normal distribution. pvalue>0.05
