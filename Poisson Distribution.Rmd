```{r}
r <- rpois(
  n = 100,
  lambda = 4
)

hist(r, main = " Histogram of 100 Random Poisson observations")
```

```{r}
lamda <- 4
lamda
mean <- mean(r)
mean
var <- var(r)
var
```
### Lambda, the mean, and the variance are all very close in value.


# Density of a Poisson distribution

```{r}
dpois(
  x = -10:10,
  lambda = mean
)
```

# Cumulative distribution function of a Poisson distribution

```{r}
ppois(
  q = -10:10,
  lambda = mean
)
```

# Quantiles of a Poisson distribution

```{r}
qpois(
  p = c(
    0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1
  ),
  lambda = mean
)
```
